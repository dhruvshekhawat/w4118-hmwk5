VM_INSPECTOR Analysis:

Using the vm_inspector we dumped the page tables for 4 processes belonging to
the following apps: Angry Birds, Google Chrome, Facebook, as well as for Zygote.
We also dumped the contents of /proc/pid/maps for each of these processes.

Upon analysis of the vm_inspector dumps we identified common PTEs between
multiple processes. We crosschecked these outputs with the outputs of
/proc/pid/maps and identified the names of what these common memory regions
pointed to.

What we found was not surprising at all, given the group written part of the
second homework assignment. As we identified earlier in the semester:

"Zygote optimizes memory usage by sharing the core libraries across child
processes instead of copying them over for each fork()-ed child" (team18, hw2)

Thus, we found a bunch of libraries that are shared across all processes, which
originate from Zygote. We concluded that these libraries are common because they
all point to the same physical frames. That is aligned with the purpose of
shared objects (.so dynamic libraries) that are common and read-only to multiple
processes within the same system.

The output of our analysis can be found in 'vm_inspector/common_libs.txt'.
