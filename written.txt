VM_INSPECTOR Analysis:

We dumped the page tables for 3 processes belonging to the following apps:
Angry Birds, Google Chrome, Facebook, as well as for Zygote. We also dumped the
contents of /proc/pid/maps for each of these processes.

Upon inspection of the vm_inspector dumps we identified common PTEs between the
multiple processes. We crosschecked these outputs with the outputs of
/proc/pid/maps and identified the names of what these common memory regions pointed to.

What we found was not surprising at all, given the group written part of the
second homework assignment. As we identified earlier in the semester:

"Zygote optimizes memory usage by sharing the core libraries across child
processes instead of copying them over for each fork()-ed child" (team18, hw2)

Thus, we found a bunch of libraries that are shared across all processes, which
originate from Zygote. The output of our analysis can be found in
'common_libs.txt' in the 'vm_inspector' folder.
